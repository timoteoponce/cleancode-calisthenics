= Clean code

Clean code is a mindset, above everything it must achieve the goal of being flexible enough to be changed in the future.

IMPORTANT: Above all, we must write code that is simple to read and change

An example of non clean code:

[source,c#]
----
// This is a representation of a car piece or part
public class O_P {
    public string m_id { get; set; }
    public string m_dsc { get; set; }
    public string m_cst { get; set; }

    public void f32(int v) {
        this.m_cst = this.m_cst + v;
    }
}

// This is a representation of a car
public class O_C {
    public string m_mdl { get; set; }
    public string m_brd { get; set; }
    public List<O_P> m_prt = new List<O_P>();

    // add a part if it's not present
    public void f33(O_P p) {
        var p2 = this.m_prt.Find( t => t.m_id == p.m_id);
        if (p2 == null) {
            this.m_prt.Add(p2);
        }
    }
}
----

This is non-readable code, we don't know what it does nor how to change it. But we have the following rules that we can use to clean it.

== Clean code calisthenics

1. Don't use single letters as variable names
2. Name variables and methods names in a meaningful way
3. At most 2 levels of indentation per method
4. One dot per line
5. Keep all methods short, maximum of 7 lines

Applying the first rule we have:
[source,c#]
----
// This is a representation of a car piece or part
public class CarPart {
    public string id { get; set; }
    public string description { get; set; }
    public string cost { get; set; }

    public void increaseCost(int additionaCost) {
        cost = cost + additionaCost;
    }
}

// This is a representation of a car
public class Car {
    public string model { get; set; }
    public string brand { get; set; }
    public List<CarPart> parts = new List<CarPart>();

    // add a part if it's not present
    public void addPart(CarPart part) {
        var existingPart = FindPart(part);
        if (existingPart == null) {
            parts.Add(part);
        }
    }

    private CarPart? FindPart(CarPart part) {
        foreach (var current in parts){
            if (Object.Equals(current, part)) {
                return current;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}
